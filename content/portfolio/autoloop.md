A plugin for Claude Code that enables AI agents to work autonomously through complex tasks without constant human intervention. Instead of stopping after each step, the agent iterates until the task is genuinely complete.

**Key capabilities:**

- Autonomous iteration with self-correction when errors occur
- Configurable safety limits to prevent runaway loops
- Git commits at each milestone for full transparency and easy rollback
- Promise-based completion ensures tasks are actually finished, not just abandoned
